            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>Binary Image Classification is a vital application of deep learning in the field of computer vision. This
                project focuses on building a high-performance binary image classification model using ML.NET, a
                powerful machine learning framework for .NET developers. By leveraging transfer learning and a
                pre-trained ResNet v2 model, this project demonstrates how to effectively automate the visual inspection
                process, such as identifying structural damage in bridge decks.</p>
            <p>Transfer learning allows us to utilize the extensive knowledge embedded in a pre-trained model,
                drastically reducing the training time while ensuring high accuracy. The use of ML.NET makes this
                approach accessible and efficient for developers working within the .NET ecosystem.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
            <h3>Data Preparation</h3>
            <p>The project begins with preparing the dataset, where images are resized, normalized, and labeled. The
                images are split into training, validation, and test sets to ensure a robust evaluation of the model.
            </p>
            <h3>Model Architecture</h3>
            <p>The model is based on the 101-layer ResNet v2 architecture, renowned for its depth and ability to capture
                intricate features in images. The pre-trained layers of ResNet are used as the foundation, with only the
                final classification layers being retrained to distinguish between the two target classes.</p>
            <h3>Training Process</h3>
            <p>The training process is divided into two phases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bottleneck Phase:</strong> Features are extracted using the frozen layers of the ResNet
                    model, which act as a high-level feature detector.</li>
                <li><strong>Training Phase:</strong> The final classification layer is trained on the extracted features
                    to distinguish between the binary classes. The model is iteratively refined to optimize accuracy and
                    minimize loss.</li>
            </ul>

    <section id="results" class="content-section">
        <div class="container">
            <h2>Results and Evaluation</h2>
            <p>The model's performance is evaluated using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
                On the test dataset, the model achieved a remarkable accuracy, showcasing its capability to reliably
                differentiate between the two target classes. The results are indicative of the model's effectiveness in
                practical scenarios, where accurate image classification is critical.</p>
            <p>The trained model is not only efficient but also scalable, making it suitable for deployment in various
                environments, from infrastructure monitoring to medical diagnostics.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project highlights the power and flexibility of using deep learning and transfer learning techniques
                in binary image classification tasks. By leveraging ML.NET and the ResNet v2 architecture, developers
                can create efficient and accurate models for complex visual tasks. The model developed in this project
                is a testament to the potential of AI in automating and improving decision-making processes in critical
                areas such as infrastructure and healthcare.</p>
            <p>Future work could involve expanding the model to handle multi-class classification tasks or integrating
                it into real-time systems for continuous monitoring and alerting.</p>
