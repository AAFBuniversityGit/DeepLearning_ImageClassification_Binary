            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning have revolutionized the field of computer vision, enabling
                machines to interpret and categorize visual data with unprecedented accuracy. This project focuses on
                building a robust binary image classification model using ML.NET, which leverages the power of
                pre-trained neural networks through transfer learning. The model is trained to perform automated visual
                inspections, such as detecting structural damage in bridge decks. By reusing knowledge from a
                pre-trained model, we can significantly reduce the training time while achieving high accuracy in
                predictions.</p>

    <section class="overview">

            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>The project uses the 101-layer ResNet v2 model, a state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN)
                architecture, as the foundation for transfer learning. The process involves two main phases:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Bottleneck Phase:</strong> Extracts features from images using the frozen layers of the
                    pre-trained model.</li>
                <li><strong>Training Phase:</strong> Trains the final layer of the model using the extracted features to
                    distinguish between two classes.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This approach allows us to quickly develop a model that can be deployed in real-world scenarios where
                automated visual inspection is crucial.</p>

            <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
            <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
            <p>Images are loaded and preprocessed by resizing and normalizing pixel values. Labels are converted to keys
                for efficient model training.</p>
            <h3>Model Training</h3>
            <p>The training pipeline utilizes the ResNet v2 architecture, optimized for binary classification tasks. The
                model undergoes multiple iterations of training, with regular evaluation of metrics such as accuracy and
                loss.</p>
            <h3>Evaluation</h3>
            <p>The model's performance is assessed using a separate test dataset, ensuring that it generalizes well to
                unseen data. Key metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 score, are calculated to evaluate the
                model's effectiveness.</p>
            <h3>Prediction</h3>
            <p>The trained model is used to classify new images, providing predictions with confidence scores.</p>

            <h2>Results</h2>
            <p>The model achieved an accuracy of [insert accuracy]% on the test dataset, demonstrating its capability to
                reliably differentiate between the two classes. The low loss and high precision metrics indicate that
                the model is well-suited for deployment in environments requiring automated visual inspections, such as
                infrastructure monitoring or medical diagnostics.</p>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This project illustrates the power of combining transfer learning with deep learning frameworks like
                ML.NET to develop highly effective AI models in a fraction of the time it would take to train from
                scratch. The binary image classification model created here can be adapted and expanded for various
                real-world applications, showcasing the versatility and potential of AI in solving complex visual tasks.
