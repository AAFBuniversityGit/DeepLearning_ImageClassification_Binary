            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>This project is a binary image classification solution for detecting bridge deck damage using deep
                learning and ML.NET. The model is trained using transfer learning, which adapts a pretrained ResNet
                model for the specific task.</p>

            <h2>How It Works</h2>
            <p>The process starts with loading images from the dataset, followed by preprocessing them into a suitable
                format. The model is then trained and evaluated to ensure accuracy. Finally, predictions are made on new
                images, and the results are displayed.</p>

            <h2>Code Analysis</h2>
            <p>The code defines several functions to load, preprocess, train, and evaluate the model. The
                `LoadImagesFromDirectory` function reads images and labels from the dataset. The `ClassifySingleImage`
                and `ClassifyImages` functions demonstrate the model's capability to predict the class of new images.
